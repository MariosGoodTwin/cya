Setting up cya on 'archive' and 'target' hosts

- on the archive host:
	* install cya in /opt/cya
	* create /etc/cya based on archive/etc_cya
	* create ssh key for access to target hosts (and back) in /etc/cya/keys

	* create user named 'archive'
	* add the public key from /etc/cya/keys to archive's authorized_keys

	* edit /etc/cya/run backup driver script to point it to right target hosts
	* add to /etc/cya/run to crontab, to be run daily

- on each target host
	* install cya to /opt/cya

	* create user bkp
	* add archive host's key to bkp's authorized_keys
	* add sudoers entry to /etc/sudoers.d/bkp from target/etc_sudoers.d

	* create /etc/cya based on target/etc_cya
	* edit /etc/cya/backup script to specify how and what to back up
